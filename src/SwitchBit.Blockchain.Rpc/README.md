# BitcoinRpcClient Caveats

There are a couple nuances that need addressed before effectively using the RPC client. One of which is that the `getrawtransaction` method doesn't pull arbitrary transaction data by default anymore. 

## Parsing blocks is slow!
Asynchronous methods of parsing are being investigated, but aren't a priority since a normalized database should only need seeded with blockchain data one time. Transforming the entire chain at *around* **150GB** (End of November, 2017) takes a few hundred hours initially on a rather beefy machine. 

## Enabling `getrawtransaction`
In order for the `getrawtransaction` RPC method to return the indexed transaction info, the blocks' contents need reindexed to include all transaction data. **After v0.8.0.0**, only transactions pertinent to a local wallet are indexed.

* ### Reindex the blocks and transaction data on disk

Start the `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` with the following arguments or add them to your `bitcoin.conf` for the node:

```powershell
 -rpcallowip=192.168.0.0/24 -rpcuser=test -rpcpassword=password -txindex=1 -reindex=1 -server
```

This could take quite a while to finish, but
**when this is complete** stop your `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` client/process.

* ### Remove reindex argument and relaunch
This could take a while to finish. Once it completes, you can remove the following argument from the `command line` and/or `bitcoin.conf`:

~~`-reindex=1`~~

* ### Relaunch bitcoin process

Launch either `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` with the **`-reindex=1`** argument removed or edit your `bitcoin.conf` again to remove the key/value.

Here's the final command line arguments relavent to `getrawtransaction`:

```powershell
-rpcallowip=192.168.0.0/24 -rpcuser=testuser -rpcpassword=password -txindex=1 -server
```

Now you should be able to make an RPC call to `getrawtransaction` and have the results return properly
